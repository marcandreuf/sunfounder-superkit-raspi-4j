# Sunfounder superkit Java exercises for Raspberry pi

This project is a direct translation of the C code for the SunFounder Super kit exercises. This is a first study about how to add jUnit testing and Java Abstractions on top of the Pi4j library.


The original C code of the Sunfounder super kit is in [github](https://github.com/sunfounder/Sunfounder_SuperKit_C_code_for_RaspberryPi).

The JAVA library [Pi4J](http://pi4j.com/) enables to use JAVA to control the Raspberry Pi boards.

Full explanation of these translation exercises can be found in my [blog posts](http://marcandreuf.blogspot.com.es/2015/03/hello-good-to-see-you-reading-this-post.html)
